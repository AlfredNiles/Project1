      <p>Hail and welcome, dear traveller, to a modest collection of stories from the world of <b><i>Aurenia</b></i>; a land brimming of magic and adventure, of strife and conflict, of mystery and discovery.  Our world is rich in it's history, and our collection grows constantly as we catalogue heroes and events of our day, and the times of our past.  But first, <i>a story!</i> A small tale of our past for those who wish to understand how this world has come to be.</p>

      <p>Before our Common Era, the Kathgir (High King) Olethrios ruled with an iron fist over the wild tribes of the Eastern continent of Reilos, uniting an otherwise savage people under a common banner.  There were those, however, that rose against his authority and sought to again free their fellows who suffered under his tyrannical methods.  Civil unrest rose to full-blown rebellion, and thus began the era we know as the <b>Age of Steel</b>.  Such times called forth enspirited individuals, of both Heroic and Villainous intent, and even beasts such as the Dragons came forward to tip the scales in an attempt to end this conflict.  Many have risen and fallen, and so many more have vanished, and with them their stories and exploits which have changed the world as we once knew it.  Upon reaching the Western lands of <b>Ilasya</b>, Olethrios began a campaign which brought many civilizations, both large and small, to their knees, going so far even to strip them from our records of history.  This path lead them to the heart of the rebellion, which we know today as the grand city of Ilandria, and the armies clashed for seven days.  The battle ultimately ended after a group of rebels we know as the Ironsworn, launched a desparate raid upon the main encampment of the Olethrian army.  Many lives were lost, but ultimately, the Ironsworn took the head of the Kathgir, and finally ended this war.</p>

      <p style="padding-bottom: 10px">1232 years later, the lands of Ilasya are scarred by what remains of this olden time.  <b>The Ilandrian Front</b>, a battlefield the span of approximately 600 kilometers where Ilandria made its final stand against Olethrios in the heartland of Corbath, now lies as a dilapidated memorial of broken war machines and innumerable souls who may never be truly laid to rest. <b>The Krendorian Scar</b>, a rift which sundered the mountains of Sor and Mat to isolate the Olethrian army, now festers with an ancient plague which has wreaked havoc across the Dwarf nation of Dur'Kara for centuries, and The lush forests of <b>Amaranth</b> are threatened by a taint upon the earth which desecrates the holy lands of the Elves.  These hardships our peoples endure are not without those who stand stalwart against these threats; nor are they without those who seek to catalyze the terror of these lingering relics of a world at war.</p>
