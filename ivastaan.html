      <h3>- Life amongst the "Astari Vaas"</h3>
      <p id="pbody">The <a href="astarivaas.html">Astari Vaas</a> are a monastic sisterhood of sorceresses who have dedicated their lives to the study of the arcane world, and how it influences the world, as well as themselves.  Their matriarchal structure disallows males from initiation, and male children born within the group are typically left to be attended to by their fathers to learn a basic trade.</p>

      <p id="pbody">One Astari sorceress, who had lost three of her children during birth, finally succeeded upon her fourth who would be born a male, named Ivas.  Male children are allowed to be housed within the monastery grounds up to the age of seven, after which they must be let go.  Before the child would be returned to live with his father, however, the Highmother of the Astari Vaas requested to see the boy.  She claimed to sense an impressive level of power within the child, and wished to test him.  As the days passed and the Highmother pressed the intensity of her tests, the boy's psyche eventually succumbed to the pressure and "cracked".</p>

      <p id="pbody">While no one quite knows what occurred behind the walls of the Highmother's hall, Ivas passed his trials and was given the right to carry his mother's name of Taan, as well as an education among the Astari.  His presence was not without conflict, however; Ivas lived under the constant gaze of the Highmother, and his sisters held silent ire towards him not only for being inducted to their order, but because of what he must have done to draw interest from the Highmother.  Nonetheless, no one dared challenge him.  Ivas held an aura of someone who was capable of awesome destruction, and many whisper that this may precisely have been why the Highmother was keen upon teaching him.</p>

      <h3>- Current Life</h3>
      <p id="pbody">After years of study at the monastery, Ivas grew weary of his peers' scrutiny, and looked closer every day to what was beyond the walls of the monastery.  After completing his education and meeting the disciplinary demands of the Highmother, he now travels the lands of Ilasya, applying his expertise to many things, from relieving the plights of the local citizenry to teaching the young minds within the University of Ilandria.<p id="pbody"></p>

      <p id="pbody">The knowledge of the Astari Vaas is something that eludes many across the land, and as such, is highly sought after.  To see a member of the order in the wild is an odd occurence, and in his travels Ivas is often confronted by leaders who discover his origins, offering him positions of power for his services.  A core belief amongst the Astari Vaas is to never directly serve nations; the power and knowledge of the Sisters is to be used to defend against dangers which threaten all people, not to further agendas which might lead to such dangers.  He is often pestered by those who do not accept his belief as a valid excuse to deny his services, and has often found himself on the run from such individuals while traveling beyond Ilandria.</p>
