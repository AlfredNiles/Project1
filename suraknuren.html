      <h3>- Brittle Bonds</h3>
      <p id="pbody">Born to a mother who died a slave, and raised by a father who died in an ignorantly conducted raid, Surak lived under an outsider tribe of orcs and half-orcs lead by <a href="togughredeyes">Togugh Red-Eyes</a>, a warchief who, in his old age, had begun to lose sight of what made their tribe fearsome in the first place.  Even at a young age, Surak saw the flaws in many of Togugh's plans and tactics, and grew increasingly tired of following what he considered to be direct paths into death; constantly plunging into conflict with no plan of retreat, and trying to assault locations of peacekeepers which would always end with nearly everyone as a casualty.</p>

      <p id="pbody">One day, the tribe fell under attack by a party of knights who were tasked with finally attacking this tribe to scatter them and ultimately eliminating their threat to the outlying villages.  Surak did not see a way out of this, and sought only to end the warchief himself as a way of making amends to his fallen friends who had died because of Togugh's failed plans.  In the middle of the chaos, Surak and Togugh fought until Surak found himself on his back with Togugh's axe ready to fall into his chest.  But before the final blow could be placed, a knight skewered Togugh with his lance, and offered his hand to Surak.  He had seen the fight and believed he saw a desire in Surak to change his path in life.  Wether it was the kindness the man had shown him, or the fact that there was nothing left for him to go to, Surak accepted, and after the battle had ended, the knight, named <a href="sirfinley">Finley</a>, had accepted Surak to be his squire.</p>

        <h3>- Blood Thicker Than Water</h3>
      <p id="pbody">Sir Finley gave Surak a home and an education, both in the ways of magic which Surak had shown an natrual aptitude for, as well as in the art of war, where Finley personally trained him to fight more properly and tactically.  He had even sometimes been brought to patrol alongside Finley, but these were the times where Surak always saw the distrust in the eyes of those he was supposed to believe were his brothers; a deep-seated prejudice due to his upbringing, and one that no matter what he did, nothing ever seemed to sway their beliefs.</p>

      <p id="pbody">As they were patrolling one day, they were ambushed by a group of bandits who sought to steal their horses.  While the patrol managed to fight them back, Finley had been dealt a blow which he could not recover from.  He died on their travel home, and Surak brought him to the Temple of Aetheon Pax to be funeralized.  For the first time in the nine years, Surak mourned the loss of a man he saw in equal measure to his father.  Understanding that Finley was the only person who would want Surak at his side, he made preparations to leave the service and set off on his own to perform mercenary work, carrying with him the memory and lessons of Sir Finley, his mentor and savior.</p>
