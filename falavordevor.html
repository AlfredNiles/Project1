      <h3>- A Dream of Adventure</h3>
      <p id="pbody">Falavor DeVor began his young life in the pits of social despair.  Though he was born to a noble set of parents and raised proper, he often found himself a social pariah of sorts.  With hardly any sort of friendships or activities to get him out of the house, he would spend his idle time mulling over the adventures of heroes in ages past, stored within the tomes whch lined his father's study.  When he came of age to set out on his own, he had ended up joining with a small-time band of mercenaries in hopes of joining the ranks of those heroes he adored.</p>

      <p id="pbody">The leader of the band presented them with their bounty: A small encampment of goblins to the west of Tamra had been endangering trade caravans that came along the main road, and the town had gathered a sizeable reward for anyone who would be able to put a stop to them.  Falavor and his band prepared and set off towards the camp, and would take their approach quietly.  Once in view of the camp, the leader of the company attempted to rally everyone for a strategy.  However, Falvor had other, more grandois ideas in mind.</p>

      <p id="pbody">With a leap and a bound, Falavor, filled with adventurous spirit and without a care of the consequences, took to the highest nearby rock and announced their presence and make a heroic statement to the goblins.  Attempting to improvise a clever line of dialogue proved more difficult in the moment, however, and one goblin took advantage of Falavor's bumbling to throw a spear which struck his shoulder, and Falavor tumbled into the deep pits of unconsciousness after a nasty fall.  Waking after the ensuing fight, he saw that none of his fellows were left alive, but all the goblins had either fallen or ran off.  In a moment of desparation and fear, he sought the late leader of his mercenary group next to 3 dead goblins, and took from his body the contract, along with any money the others may have still had left on them, and fled back to town.</p>

      <p id="pbody">While Falavor had survived this encounter despite his most terrible efforts, he twice as much feared his parents shame and disappointment, and decided to leave and become a merchant in Ilandria.  Falavor could not find work to sustain himself in Ilandria, but was able to fund a minor education for himself in the arts of alchemy.  With his newfound knowledge, he was able to join a Merchant's guild and lived an honest life in the city.  But simpllicity didn't last long for Falavor, as one day after a travel to the port town of Tamra would bring him back to his original dream.

      <h3>- Reawakening</h3>
      <p id="pbody">As he was peddling goods along the docks, he had been approached by a burly, heavy-set man whose breath reeked of fish when opening his mouth.  He claimed he was going to be getting himself a ship, and after a time of conversation, insisted that Falavor come to meet his band of mates.  The man brought him to a bar where he introduced his motley crew: A young Dragonkin cartographer who never seemed to let go of an odd-looking tome, an Eastern man who took quite heavily towards his pipe and wielded a large stick with mechanical bits, and a shady gnome that never seemed to join into the conversations herself, instead opting to sit and listen until pushed for an answer.</p>

      <p id="pbody">As one topic shifted to another, they all collectively turned their attention to a man who had just entered the tavern.  "<i>That's our ticket, everyone!</i>", the heavyset man whispered to the table, then up and off they went.  Falavor was left alone, completely confused, and so after a moment of waiting, he got up and headed outside.  There he saw the crew conversing with a man who was organizing the unloading of various things from a particularly elagent ship.  Falavor began to approach when suddenly, the heavy-set man sprung up and knocked the supervisor into the water below.  Pandemonium broke out amongst the groups, and slowly they were able to make their way up to the controls and started lifting the anchor and loosening the hitches.  As the ship began to set off, the crew was merrily calling for Falavor to join them.</p>

      <p id="pbody">Fate would grant Falavor yet another opportunity for adventure! While caught up in the excitement of the moment, Falavor had instictly jumped upon the netting and rolled out onto the deck.  Cheering and hollering, the crew set off into the open seas and the former captain erupted from the bar to shout explitives that, much like Falavor's guild associations, faded into the past.</p>
